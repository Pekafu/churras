Churras is a dApp providing a crypto wallet dashboard. Currently it displays all your ERC-20 and BEP-20
tokens from Ethereum and BSC chains and your wallet balance. Over time we'll be adding more features
so you'll also be able to track your yield farms, pools and NFTs.

"Churras" is a shorthand for "churrasco", which is a delicious [Brazilian style barbecue](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/churrasco).
